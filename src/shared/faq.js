            'Caves that get abused become closed to everyone, including even the most responsible, veteran cavers. People new to caving may unknowingly abuse caves; examples include touching formations or creatures, walking in protected areas, or not using pads when rigging rope. There are even some people who intentionally abuse caves, leaving behind trash, graffiti, and even human waste. We subscribe to a "leave no trace" philosophy, and do our best to protect our underground treasures from both accidental and intentional harm. This includes only sharing locations with those who we trust to also cherish and protect them.',

            "This is one of the major benefits to joining a grotto! The Timpanogos Grotto offers vertical classes, access to an entire library of caving books, publications, trips for all skill levels, and monthly educational meetings. All of our members were once new, too. We're happy to help you figure out what will work, offer guidance, and point you in the right direction. Our members range from first-time cavers to seasoned veterans and everything in between.",

        text:
            "No. Caving is an inherently dangerous activity. People are injured and die every year. The caving we do does not involve guard rails, paved paths, and stairs. The kind of caving we do is NOT a tour. This is why we take safety seriously. Also, caving is not for everyone. We are happy to get you started, but we do not hold your hand - everyone is ultimately responsible for themselves. We try to help make it as safe as possible, but caving is not simply hiking underground. If we do not think you can handle yourself safely or if you cannot follow conservation guidelines, you will not be invited on or allowed to join trips. It is not just your life at risk, it is our lives, too.",
